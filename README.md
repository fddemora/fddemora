### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### A little about me:
-  I'm Program Analyst at Cognizant Technical Solutions ðŸ–¥
- I have knowledge in web development, OOP, bash, and more
- I love learning and improvement

I'll be using Github to track my learning process, so in my repo's, you'll find all the areas that I'm learning!
